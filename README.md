-> A simple script to do basic to advanced recon.... in simple words -> a script to automate all the lazy recon flow of the hunter with the tools great people have developed.
-> Make sure you have all the dependencies installed before running this script, i'm working on creating another script to install all the tools in a single click which will be very helpful if you set up new cloud instances to start hunting.
