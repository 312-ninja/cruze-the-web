# cruze the web

- A simple script to do basic to advanced recon.... 
- In simple words -> a script to automate all the lazy recon flow of the hunter with the tools great people have developed.
- Make sure you have all the dependencies installed before running this script
- i'm working on creating another script to install all the tools in a single click which will be very helpful if you set up new cloud instances to headstart your  hunting.                                                                                                                                                             
**To Run the Script**
- chmod +x cruze.sh
- ./cruze.sh example.com
- Use only wildcard domains **\*.example.com** and not this **www.example.com**
